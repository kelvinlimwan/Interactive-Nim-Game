## NIM Assignment 2: Introduction
This project will continue the work you did on assignment 1.
Please refer to the assignment 1 specification for a detailed description of the game and its general rules.

The aim of this project is to add some more advanced features to the system you previously developed. 
In the last assignment, you created a simple Java program to handle Nim’s core game play mechanics, including a basic command prompt environment. 
In this assignment, the objective is to design and implement a more sophisticated version of Nim, making full use of Java’s object-oriented paradigm.
In addition, you will develop more advanced interactions via the command prompt.
As a bonus, we added an optional challenge for those of you who would like to dive into some more advanced topics. This bonus task can be found in the supplemental material for this assignment.

**Please refer to the full assignment 2 specifications document for the complete requirements of the program.**
